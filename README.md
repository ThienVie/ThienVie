--------------------------------

If you have some questions, there might be an answer for you. If not, you can ask me everytime you want. I will answer, if I have time for it.


* Q: Why do you write "import string"? I don't get it.

 A: Because I heard from someone that there is every numbers, special characters, and letters. I am lazy, you know? And if I make one little mistake, I will regret it for decades.


* Q: Are you the one in the Discord channel?

 A: Erm...yeah, I think. There are also users with a random nickname and random numbers behind the #. It might be me, but it might be not me, too.


* Q: How are you today?

 A: Thank you for the question. I am happy to help someone. That is all. :D


* Q: Which python version does it work?

 A: I think 3.9


* Q: Why don't you use liceses?

 A: I am not good in english. There are so much unknown words. That is all.
