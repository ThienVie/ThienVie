Hi, I'm ThienViet. I am a programmer who uses Python(v3.11) to create things. I like games, swimming, sprinting and coding.

Ask me all you want. Please, remember that I might not be online all the time, because I have other things to do, but I try to reply as fast as I can.

You can reach me with this e-mail: ThienViet3@proton.me
